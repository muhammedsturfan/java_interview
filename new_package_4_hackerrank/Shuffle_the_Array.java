    /*
    Given an array nums of 2n elements, the task is to shuffle the array in such a
    way that the resulting array is in the form [x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn],
    where [x1, x2, ..., xn] are the first n elements of nums, and [y1, y2, ..., yn]
    are the last n elements of nums.


    Example 1:

        Input: nums = [2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 7], n = 3
        Output: [2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 7]
        Explanation:
        First half: [2, 5, 1]
        Second half: [3, 4, 7]
        Shuffled: [2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 7]
